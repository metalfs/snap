# HLS_MEMCOPY EXAMPLE

* Provides a simple base allowing to discover SNAP
* C code allows copying to/from :
  * HOST memory (for example a file)
  * DDR FPGA attached on board memory
  * Block RAM memory (memory inside the FPGA itself)
* Example routine details the copy mechanism.

Detailed information can be found in the [actions/hls_memcopy/doc](./doc) directory
